# MindLedger

**Unlimited AI, earned by thinking.** A responsive local-first prototype for building healthier AI-use habits through independent practice, focus sessions, short breaks, and progress tracking.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add a Gemini API key to enable AI replies. Keep that key in the server `.env` file; do not use a `VITE_` prefix or commit the key. The app can still be explored without a key, but AI chat will show a setup message.

`npm run dev` starts the Vite frontend and local Express API. `npm test` runs prompt/workflow contract checks; `npm run build` creates the production frontend bundle. `npm start` serves the production preview and API locally. The interface loads DM Sans and Manrope from Google Fonts when network access is available; system sans-serif fonts are used as fallback.

## Demo accounts

All demo passwords are `demo1234`.

| Role | Email |
| --- | --- |
| Parent | `parent@mindledger.demo` |
| Child | `child1@mindledger.demo` (also `child2@mindledger.demo`) |
| HR Manager/Admin | `admin@mindledger.demo` |
| Worker | `worker1@mindledger.demo` through `worker5@mindledger.demo` |
| Teacher | `teacher@mindledger.demo` |
| Student | `student1@mindledger.demo` through `student6@mindledger.demo` |
| Individual | Register through the Personal segment; no group code is required |

Demo data uses invented names and seeded sessions. Use the role matching the selected segment to log in.

## What is implemented

- Landing, segment and role selection, login and registration flows.
- Personal segment with an Individual account that does not require a group or invitation code.
- Parent, child, HR/admin, worker, teacher and student demo roles.
- Family/company/class group creation and invitation codes; member registration validates group codes and duplicate emails.
- Local browser persistence for demo profile, sessions, draft mission responses, credit transactions, theme, and session.
- Member views for the five-skill cognitive balance sheet, Think Credits, mission practice, focus timer, optional reaction-time and working-memory challenges, self-reported distraction logging, wander breaks, progress charts, and recent activity.
- One AI Coach for every profile, with a Think First / Instant Answer switch. Each response style has its own local chat list; Think First gives a short cue before the learner chooses a hint or solution, while Instant Answer responds directly. The Coach also handles planning, writing, coding, and everyday questions. Gemini is called by a local Express endpoint, with chat history kept in browser localStorage.
- Five playable cognitive games: Recall Lab, Logic Forge, Clarity Sprint, Idea Lab, and Signal Sprint. Each saves an attempt into the member skill/activity history; games do not award credits or modify cognitive-debt/repaid totals.
- Deterministic mission feedback based on response length, vocabulary variety and task-specific terms. Confidence is recorded with the session. Drafts can be resumed on the same device.
- Credit ledger reconciles earn/spend transactions. Mission rewards are applied once per completed submission; the three-per-day break reward cap is enforced from ledger entries.
- Parent, HR/admin and teacher dashboards with group-linked demo data, chart filters, people views, recommendation rules, alerts/observations, and CSV export.
- Supervisor interfaces contain aggregate scores and activity only. They do not render mission answers or private break reflections. Member responses are saved only with their private local session record.
- Light/dark themes, accessible labels, keyboard focus styling, responsive layouts, reduced-motion support, fixed global bars, and friendly validation.

## What is simulated or seeded

- Authentication is simulated. Demo passwords are stored in local browser state, so this is not secure authentication and must not be used with real credentials or sensitive information.
- Data lives in `localStorage` on one browser/device. There is no server, multi-device sync, account recovery, authorization service, or organization isolation boundary. Browser storage can be inspected or changed by the device owner.
- Seeded metrics and sessions are sample data, not real observations. Some chart fallbacks are illustrative where no matching daily session exists and should be treated as sample trends.
- Think Credits are a local prototype ledger. AI chat does not spend credits; the allowance does not meter or guarantee access to Gemini. API quota and billing are controlled by the configured Gemini account.
- AI requests are sent to Google Gemini. The server does not persist chat requests, and chat history is kept in this browser. The local server is bound to `127.0.0.1`; it has no authenticated API sessions or per-account access control and is not suitable for deployment to multiple users as-is. Add real authentication, authorization, provider privacy/retention review, and service-side abuse controls before exposing it beyond localhost.
- Gemini replies were not live-validated unless a working `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured. The included 20-question suite checks prompt/mode and workflow contracts; it does not measure model answer quality.
- Focus scores and optional challenges are prototype interactions; distraction logging is self-reported. Nothing monitors other applications or verifies a break.
- Cognitive debt and repayment are experimental product indicators, not validated psychological, educational, or medical measurements.
- Contact delivery and automated AI recommendations/evaluation are not connected. Recommendations use transparent deterministic rules.

## Architecture and data model

The React + TypeScript + Vite frontend uses Recharts for visualizations and Lucide icons. `src/model.ts` defines `Person`, `Group`, `Session`, skills, and invented demo fixtures. `src/App.tsx` contains prototype authentication, group management, local persistence, scoring, credit ledger updates, deterministic recommendations, analytics, role dashboards, and interactive sessions. `src/ChatPanel.tsx` provides the two AI modes and local chat history. `server/index.ts` holds the Gemini key server-side and exposes the localhost chat endpoint; `server/prompts.ts` defines tutor and general-assistant instructions. `server/workflow.ts` bounds Coach stages and hints. `src/GamePanel.tsx` contains the five deterministic games and records their results. `src/styles.css` contains the shared responsive light/dark visual system.

The application state models users, groups, sessions, skill metrics, and credit transactions. Mission responses are attached to member-owned session records and are never included in supervisor rendering. A production server must enforce this boundary in API responses and database policies, not rely on UI filtering.

## Shared database design for multiple devices

The first shared-data design is Supabase PostgreSQL. Its schema is in `supabase/migrations/202610110001_shared_progress.sql`. This migration is a design artifact only: the current app still reads and writes browser `localStorage`, so cross-device sync is not active yet.

The shared database stores authenticated profiles, group memberships and invites, activity scores and safe game measurements, per-skill stats, XP awards, and the Think Credit ledger. Supabase Auth owns passwords and login sessions. Private mission answers and reflections use an owner-only table. AI Coach history, drafts, theme, and device preferences stay local by default; chat is private and is not needed to calculate shared progress.

The migration enables Row Level Security. Members can read their own progress. Group supervisors receive a narrow roster and aggregate activity API; they cannot read chat, mission answers, or private reflections. XP and credit ledgers are append-only from the client's perspective, with writes reserved for trusted server functions. Unique idempotency keys prevent two devices from awarding the same reward twice.

To activate sync, the app still needs Supabase Auth in place of its demo/local login, a trusted API or Edge Functions to create profiles and memberships and record activity/rewards transactionally, and a client data layer that loads and saves this account data instead of `mindledger.v1` localStorage. Configure the Supabase URL and publishable key in the deployed frontend, and keep the service-role key only in trusted server secrets. Do not migrate demo passwords or seed accounts as real users. Do not expose service credentials in frontend variables.

Before inviting real users, review account deletion, backup/restore, consent and retention for minors and organizations, and role permissions with representative accounts. A Supabase project and credentials are required before the schema can be applied to a live database.

## Production-readiness checklist

- [ ] Implement real provider authentication and secure session lifecycle.
- [ ] Add server-side APIs, schema migrations, authorization policies, and per-group data isolation.
- [ ] Move credit operations and eligibility checks into atomic server transactions.
- [ ] Add privacy/consent flows suitable for children, schools, and workplace use in target jurisdictions.
- [ ] Review retention/deletion, exports, incident response, and supervisor access logging.
- [ ] Review accessibility and contrast with assistive technology and representative devices.
- [ ] Configure production hosting, CSP, dependency review, observability, and backups.
- [ ] Validate the experimental metrics with appropriate research before making outcome claims.
